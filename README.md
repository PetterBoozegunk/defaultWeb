Some html/css/javascript features that I like to reuse in the future

To start the included webserver cmd to the website root and run "node server.js"  (you have to have <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs</a> installed on your computer).

To get the gulp thing to work cmd to the /UI/ folder an run "npm install"
