Some html/css/javascript features that I like to reuse in the future

To start the included webserver just click on "startServer.bat" (you have to have <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs</a> installed on your computer).

To get the grunt and/or gulp thing to work cmd to the /UI/ folder an run "npm install"
